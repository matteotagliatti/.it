**Travel**. This year I've really enjoyed my summer vacation in **California**, from **San Diego** to **San Francisco**. Also **Naples**. I love that city. I would like to live there for a bit once in a while.

**Dev**. Fallen in love with **React**, **Next**, and in particular RSC. And in this new job, I'm all in with it. For 2024 I want to do even more with it. It's such a huge community and ecosystem.

**Books**. [Press Reset](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55277893-press-reset) by Jason Schreiner, [Project Hail Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Hail_Mary) by Andy Weir, and [Dilla Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilla_Time) by Dan Charmas.

**Music**. [The Alchemist](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0eVyjRhzZKke2KFYTcDkeu?si=QQsJSYJKS4m_OIy4uus7ww) is my favorite producer for the last 3/4, an incredible run. [The Hillbillies](https://open.spotify.com/track/1h6w4POXM2LfG4ZD4xUfZQ?si=9caebf2a2ea5483a) and [The Faster Blade](https://open.spotify.com/track/0DMpKFgwFvSql4ufb7IVFO?si=f7e58239c8e44fc4) were my favorite tracks of the year. I think I can JPEGMAFIA as one of my favorite artists.

**Movies**. [Babylon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10640346/) on the way home from the USA and [The Creator](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11858890/). For this last one I know, the plot is simply bad, but wow, visually is one of the best things I've seen till Dune.

**TV**. [The Bear](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bear_(TV_series)>) and [Shameless](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shameless_(American_TV_series)>) (worse than crack, can't stop watching it).

**Games**. I realize that now I enjoy only games with great characters, stories, and settings. Gameplay is not my main drive when I play a game, and it may be why I don't play so many games like in the past. In particular, I liked games where the main part is reading. My favorite of the year has been: **Red Dead Redemption 2**, **Disco Elysium**, **Pentiment**, and **Citizen Sleeper**. **Jusant** was my last game of the year. A good one.

**Podcast**. [Search Engine](https://open.spotify.com/show/76VOmPpOHaTyA1OaRc4BDv?si=6beb499c90d44baf) was my favorite English podcast. The usual [Ball Don't Lie](https://open.spotify.com/show/4FLzid8ymxgHEido9eOw3j?si=e6919d7c85794d6a) and [Dove nessuno parla](https://open.spotify.com/show/36ZECce3GCbgqrilE2kcaJ?si=9f2d0943bcfb4392) my Italian favorite.

**YouTube**. [Digging The Greats](https://www.youtube.com/@diggingthegreats) is such a fantastic channel. [Francesco Costa](https://www.youtube.com/@francescocosta21) was my favorite in Italian.

**Software**. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a really good piece of software, I was writing in it only for the incredible Markdown editor, but I don't need anything as fancy in my daily life. [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) is something I really want to try better.

**Good intentions for the new year**. This year I want to start learning _Vim Motions_ for real and maybe switch to it for some small project. Learn React very well. Enjoy life more, without overthinking too much about what on how.
