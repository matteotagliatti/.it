Kendrick Lamar’s “Complexion” is a great example of a transition between Straight Time and Dilla Time, and a way to get a visceral sense of how difficult it is for humans to hold the tensions between the two time-feels. At 2:10, as Kendrick begins singing “I like it, I love it,” begin tapping your finger or foot along with the beat. You are in Straight Time. At 2:30, as the beat fades out, keep tapping your finger at the same tempo. Let the rhythm of the vocals and the piano guide you. Then, as the new, conflicted beat fades in after 2:35, try to hold the tempo with your finger. By 2:43, you are in Dilla Time.
