sell my soul to the Assault Bike

what I hope you take away from this manual is that you have to listen to your body.

start to notice how your diet affects how you feel physically and emotionally.

So start developing your body awareness now. It’ll be inconvenient at first because you’ll have to go out of your way to check in with how you’re feeling, but gradually it becomes second nature. Then you’ll be better equipped to distinguish between discomfort that you can train through and pain that you should stop and address.

When you’re in that much pain, you may want to lie on the couch all day. But you’ve got to get up and do some light exercise in order to circulate your blood, clear some of the lactic acid out, and reduce the soreness. But the key word here is “light,” light enough that you can hold a conversation while you do it.

The other fundamental of recovery is to get your core temperature down after every workout, especially if you’re hoping to work out again that day.
