Rhythm and blues was well-known as Negro music, and one couldn’t just start playing Negro songs on a respectable station. The solution required a bit of subterfuge. So Freed changed his handle to “Moondog,” and changed the name of the music from “rhythm and blues” to a phrase unknown to Whites, “rock and roll”—which, when one considered the meaning of the term, was even more suggestive.

The big record companies of the 1950s—RCA, Columbia, Capitol—traditionally relegated “race music” to smaller imprints, if they dealt with Black music and Black artists at all.

The beats under Rakim’s incantations were different, too. Instead of using turntables to manually loop breaks, as Rick Rubin had, Marley Marl employed new technologies to do the same thing—a digital recorder called a “sampler,” coupled with a digital clock called a “sequencer” to trigger the samples—making it possible to perfectly time the breaks like a DJ would, or to cut up the individual drum sounds into pieces to play in new rhythms. In the records of the “Bridge Wars,” both Marley and Scott “La Rock” Sterling used sampling as their chief weapon, too; their records were a departure from the crisp and clean Def Jam sound. The culmination of this new technique came in the late spring of 1987 with the release of Eric B & Rakim’s “I Know You Got Soul.” The premise was simple: Two well-known breaks—one from James Brown and the other from Funkadelic—were layered on top of each other, running at the same time; no drum machine at all, save for a triggered, booming 808 kick drum. The impact was revolutionary. In using computers to sample and layer long pieces of real drum breaks, hip-hop had freed itself from the rigid grid of drum machines.

Suddenly, the music behind Rakim was as loose and syncopated as his rhymes. The versatility of the digital sampler allowed an infinite range of musical expression. The beat-box era was

Yet the commercial success of hip-hop was also largely due to the work of Rubin and Simmons. With their first records, “It’s Yours” and “Sucker MCs,” Rubin and Simmons turned rap records from nine-minute “toasts” to three-minute songs with classic pop structure—verse, bridge, and chorus. In so doing, the Def Jam partners made it possible for rappers to express themselves as pop artists. Def Jam’s records and tours opened hip-hop to a vast global audience.
